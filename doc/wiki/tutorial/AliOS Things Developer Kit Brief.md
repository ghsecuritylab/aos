## Description
**Developer Kit** is hardware development board base on AliOS, with a variety of peripherals. Hardware is equipped with Audio Codec, eight sensors, 8-bits digital camera, LCD display, sixes LEDs, PCIe module, USB OTG FS, and Wi-Fi module.
Because the software is embedded with the AliOS system, the local data uploading to the Ali-cloud can be realized through Wi-Fi. It is convenience to the developer to learn about the development environment in combination with practical applications.
